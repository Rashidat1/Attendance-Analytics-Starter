Student attendance alone did not fully capture engagement. 
Some students attend sessions but left early, while others remain consistently engaged. 
The system successfully differentiates between attendance and true engagement.
It flags students with low engagement for early intervention and provides actionable insights into patterns of participation across days and individuals.

KEY INSIGHTS

Students were grouped into three categories: Shown on the bar chart - Active students

Consistently Engaged (~88–92 minutes average duration, not flagged).

Active but Short Duration (attend but stay < 60 minutes).

Flagged Low Engagement (system‑identified as disengaged).


Peak days: Shown on the bar chart of the most active day of the week. 

Identifies which weekday consistently has the highest attendance (Wednesdays). 

Low‑engagement days: Spots weaker days (Sundays)
